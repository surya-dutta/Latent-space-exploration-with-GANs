Latent space exploration of images (faces) using generative adversarial networks (GANs).

Employed interpolation and latent space exploration of images using probabilistic generative models like a Conditional GAN and a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder to synthesize and classify faces with different facial expressions from unpaired images in a dataset of human faces (CelebA). After training the models, their performance was evaluated by generating images conditioned on various facial expressions, such as happy, sad, and angry. The generated images showed realistic facial expression variations while preserving the face's overall structure, and the morphing of one image into another was accomplished by interpolating between the latent representations of the two images, which allowed for a smooth transition between two facial expressions while maintaining the identity of the face.
